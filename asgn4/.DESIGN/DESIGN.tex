		\item{h : Command line options }
		\item{v : Verbose printing; prints all Hamiltonian paths found as well
			as total number of recursive calls to dfs()}
		\item{u : Specifes the graph to be undirected}
		\item{i : infile; the input file contaiing the cities and edges of a graph (default should be stdin)}
		\item{o : outfile; the output file to print to (default is stdout)}
	\end{itemize}

	No need to use a set, just set defaults than change on parse.
