# Stacks and Queues

## Arrays and Linked Lists

* Arrays
	* Allow random access:
		* each element can be accessed directly in constant time
* Linked Lists
	* Linked lists allow sequential access:
		* Each element can only be accessed in a particular order

## Stacks and Queues

* *Container* data types
	* lick a box, we don't care about the box but what it contains
* Both have:
	* well-defined semantics
	* A fixed set of operations
	* A distinct ordering to their elements

#### Stacks

* LIFO
* delete datatype when not using anymore

#### Priority Queue

* Added to queue like normal, but element of highest priority is dequeued


# HINT

* bigger then uint32_t bc they get real big
