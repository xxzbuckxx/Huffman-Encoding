## Boolean Algebra

* set mathematics on a logical foundation
* true and false
* three basic operators:
	* and (&& in C)
	* or (|| in C)
	* not (! in C)
* we will use *true* = 1 and *false* = 0
* **Truth table will probably be on a test**
* and (also called conjunction
* or (also called *inclusive-or* or *Disjunction*
* not (also called *Negation*)
* exclusive-or (xor)
* can swamp two variables without a temp using exclusive or

## True and False in C

* In C:
	* 0 is false
	* everything that isn't false is true
	* logical expression have type int
	* stdbool.h
		* you can have true and false if you use this 
	* do not count on not 0 being 1 (just use not 0 for true) 

**You can jump out of a structure do not jump into a scope**
